    synopsis: "21 Lessons is a collection of philosophical reflections inspired by falling down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. The mysterious nature of Bitcoin seems to attract all kinds of curious characters, leading to a vibrant community of builders, thinkers, and writers. Gigi is one of them. What started as an innocent question about the number of bitcoin in existence turned into a multi-year journey down various rabbit holes. The result is this distillation of philosophical insights and practical wisdom gained along the way. These 21 lessons are organized into seven chapters covering philosophy, economics, and technology.",

    title: "The Bitcoin Standard",
    author: "Saifedean Ammous",
    description: "The definitive guide to Bitcoin's economic philosophy and its potential to replace fiat money.",
    synopsis: "In The Bitcoin Standard, economist Saifedean Ammous examines the historical context of the rise of Bitcoin. From the use of seashells and stones to today's most sophisticated monetary system, Ammous guides readers through the history of technologies performing the functions of money. He explores what gave these technologies their monetary role, how most lost it, why this matters, and what it means for Bitcoin. The book demonstrates how Bitcoin's technology represents the first engineering solution to the problem of sound money in the digital age. Rather than serving as a currency, Bitcoin is better understood as a new emerging store of value technology, and possibly the best one ever invented.",

    title: "The Fiat Standard",
    author: "Saifedean Ammous",
    description: "Analysis of the current fiat monetary system and its historical development.",
    synopsis: "In The Fiat Standard, world-renowned economist Saifedean Ammous applies his unique analytical framework to examine the rise of fiat money and its far-reaching effects on government, society, and culture. In contrast to the gold standard, which limited government intervention in the economy, the fiat standard has enabled governments to expand their power dramatically. Ammous demonstrates how this has fundamentally altered the incentive structure of society, leading to higher time preference, reduced savings, and a culture of instant gratification that undermines long-term thinking.",

    title: "The Price of Tomorrow",
    author: "Jeff Booth",
    description: "Why deflation is the key to an abundant future and how technology is changing everything.",
    synopsis: "The Price of Tomorrow presents a compelling argument that we are living through the most important period in human history, where exponential technological advancement is creating a deflationary world that conflicts with our inflationary monetary system. Technology entrepreneur Jeff Booth explains how artificial intelligence, robotics, and other technologies are making goods and services cheaper and more abundant, but our debt-based monetary system requires constant inflation to function. This fundamental mismatch creates economic instability and inequality. Booth argues that we must choose between preserving the current system through increasing centralization and control, or embracing deflation and the abundance it can bring through decentralized technologies like Bitcoin.",

      synopsis: "21 Lessons is a collection of philosophical reflections inspired by falling down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. The mysterious nature of Bitcoin seems to attract all kinds of curious characters, leading to a vibrant community of builders, thinkers, and writers. Gigi is one of them. What started as an innocent question about the number of bitcoin in existence turned into a multi-year journey down various rabbit holes. The result is this distillation of philosophical insights and practical wisdom gained along the way. These 21 lessons are organized into seven chapters covering philosophy, economics, and technology.",

      synopsis: "In The Bitcoin Standard, economist Saifedean Ammous examines the historical context of the rise of Bitcoin. From the use of seashells and stones to today's most sophisticated monetary system, Ammous guides readers through the history of technologies performing the functions of money. He explores what gave these technologies their monetary role, how most lost it, why this matters, and what it means for Bitcoin. The book demonstrates how Bitcoin's technology represents the first engineering solution to the problem of sound money in the digital age. Rather than serving as a currency, Bitcoin is better understood as a new emerging store of value technology, and possibly the best one ever invented.",

In contrast to the gold standard, which limited government intervention in the economy, the fiat standard has enabled governments to expand their power dramatically. Ammous demonstrates how this has fundamentally altered the incentive structure of society, leading to higher time preference, reduced savings, and a culture of instant gratification that undermines long-term thinking.",

Technology entrepreneur Jeff Booth explains how artificial intelligence, robotics, and other technologies are making goods and services cheaper and more abundant, but our debt-based monetary system requires constant inflation to function. This fundamental mismatch creates economic instability and inequality. Booth argues that we must choose between preserving the current system through increasing centralization and control, or embracing deflation and the abundance it can bring through decentralized technologies like Bitcoin.",
