    "overview": {
      "summary": "Ruby and Python are philosophical twins born in the mid-90s, both emphasizing readability and developer happiness over raw performance. Ruby (1995) follows the 'Principle of Least Astonishment' and offers multiple elegant ways to accomplish tasks, embodying pure object-oriented design where everything, even primitives, are objects. Python (1991) follows 'There should be one obvious way to do it' from the Zen of Python, favoring explicit over implicit. Ruby exploded with Ruby on Rails (2004), dominating web development for startups. Python conquered data science, machine learning, and AI with NumPy, pandas, and TensorFlow. Ruby's metaprogramming powers exceed Python's, enabling elegant DSLs. Python's indentation-based syntax polarizes - you either love it or hate it. Both have GIL threading limitations. Ruby prioritizes programmer joy; Python prioritizes ecosystem breadth. Ruby is elegant; Python is practical.",
      "whenToUseLeft": "Choose Ruby for rapid web application development with Ruby on Rails, startups needing fast MVP delivery, projects valuing elegant, expressive code, teams prioritizing developer happiness, applications with frequently changing requirements, when metaprogramming and DSLs are beneficial, and e-commerce platforms (Shopify uses Ruby). Ruby excels when developer productivity and code beauty matter more than raw performance.",
      "whenToUseRight": "Choose Python for data science and machine learning, scientific computing and research, automation and scripting, educational projects and teaching, DevOps and infrastructure tools, projects requiring extensive libraries, applications needing interoperability with C/C++, cross-functional teams (Python is more widely known), and when ecosystem size and industry standardization matter. Python's versatility and vast community make it the safer, more mainstream choice."

      "description": "Both minimize ceremony, but Python uses a function call while Ruby uses a method.",
      "why": "Both are one-liners with no boilerplate. Ruby uses 'puts', Python uses 'print()'. Both are interpreted languages emphasizing developer happiness. Ruby reads like natural language, Python emphasizes explicit is better than implicit. Both eliminate the ceremony of compiled languages.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Both are simple one-liners",

    "comments": {
      "description": "Both use # for single-line comments. HEREDOC vs triple-quoted strings for multi-line.",
      "why": "Both use # - very similar! For multi-line, Ruby has HEREDOC (<<~) while Python has triple-quoted strings (\"\"\" or '''). Both work great. Ruby HEREDOC is more explicit with delimiters. Python triple-quotes are simpler and more \"Pythonic\". Ruby =begin/=end exists but rarely used. Python docstrings are actual objects (__doc__), Ruby HEREDOC are just strings. Python f-strings with triple quotes support interpolation - same as Ruby HEREDOC. Very similar capabilities, slightly different syntax. Both excellent.",

    "variables": {
      "description": "Both are dynamically typed with no declarations, but use different naming conventions.",
      "why": "Both are dynamically typed - no type declarations needed. Ruby uses snake_case, Python uses snake_case (they agree!). Both use UPPERCASE for constants. Ruby constants aren't truly immutable. Everything is an object in both. Very similar approaches to variables.",
