    "overview": {
      "summary": "Python and TypeScript are both modern, high-level languages that prioritize developer experience, but serve different domains. Python (1991) dominates backend services, data science, machine learning, and scripting with its 'batteries included' philosophy and massive scientific ecosystem. TypeScript (2012) dominates web development by adding optional static types to JavaScript, enabling large-scale frontend applications with confidence. Both started as dynamically typed (Python natively, TypeScript's JavaScript heritage) but embraced gradual typing (Python 3.5+ type hints, TypeScript's optional types). Python's indentation syntax polarizes; TypeScript's JavaScript compatibility provides a migration path. Both have excellent IDE support and large communities. Python compiles to bytecode and runs on Python interpreter; TypeScript compiles to JavaScript and runs in browsers/Node.js. They overlap in backend Node.js development but excel in their primary domains: Python for data/ML, TypeScript for web frontends.",
      "whenToUseLeft": "Choose Python for data science and machine learning, scientific computing and research, backend web services with Django/Flask, automation and scripting, projects requiring NumPy/pandas/TensorFlow, teaching programming, rapid prototyping across domains, DevOps automation, and when ecosystem size and library availability in data/ML space matters more than frontend integration. Python's versatility and data science dominance make it indispensable for analytical work.",
      "whenToUseRight": "Choose TypeScript for web frontend development with React/Angular/Vue, Node.js backend services, full-stack JavaScript applications, projects needing browser execution, teams with JavaScript background, modern SPA development, real-time web applications, and when type safety in JavaScript ecosystem matters. TypeScript is the pragmatic choice when your primary target is web browsers or you're building on the JavaScript/Node.js ecosystem."
