      "why": "Java was literally created to be simpler than C++! Both need main functions. C++ uses cout, Java uses System.out.println. Java compiles to bytecode for JVM. C++ compiles to native machine code. Java has garbage collection. C++ requires manual memory management. Java: 'write once, run anywhere'. C++: maximum performance.",

Documentation tools are similar. For multi-line strings, C++11 introduced raw string literals R\"( )\" which are cleaner than concatenation. Java 15 added text blocks. C++ raw strings can use custom delimiters R\"delim( )delim\" to contain )\" sequences. Java's text blocks can't do this. Both modern approaches work well, though C++'s custom delimiters offer more flexibility.",
