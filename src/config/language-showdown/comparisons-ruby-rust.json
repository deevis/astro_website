    "overview": {
      "summary": "Ruby and Rust are polar opposites in language design philosophy, yet both aim to improve programmer experience in radically different ways. Ruby (1995) achieves happiness through freedom - dynamic typing, metaprogramming, multiple ways to express ideas, and 'the principle of least astonishment.' Everything is flexible; refactoring is easy; constraints are minimal. Rust (2015) achieves confidence through constraints - the ownership system, borrow checker, and compile-time guarantees that eliminate entire bug categories. Ruby trades performance for expressiveness; Rust demands precision for safety. Ruby's metaprogramming can modify classes at runtime; Rust's macros generate code at compile time. Ruby has a GIL and garbage collection; Rust has neither. Ruby code runs slowly but writes quickly; Rust code runs at C++ speed but requires careful thought. Ruby dominates web development with Rails; Rust targets systems programming, WebAssembly, and embedded systems. They're rarely in competition - you'd use Ruby to build the website and Rust to build the high-performance backend services it depends on.",
      "whenToUseLeft": "Choose Ruby for web application development with Ruby on Rails, rapid prototyping and MVPs, startups prioritizing time-to-market, projects where developer productivity matters more than runtime performance, applications with complex business logic and frequent changes, e-commerce platforms, when metaprogramming and DSLs add value, and teams that value code readability and elegance. Ruby shines when the bottleneck is developer time, not CPU time.",
      "whenToUseRight": "Choose Rust for systems programming, performance-critical components, concurrent/parallel processing with safety guarantees, WebAssembly compilation, embedded systems, operating system components, blockchain and cryptocurrency projects, game engines, CLI tools needing speed, replacing C/C++ in critical paths, and when memory safety and zero-cost abstractions justify the learning curve. Rust excels when bugs are expensive and performance is mandatory."

For multi-line strings, Ruby HEREDOC (<<~) is more elegant than Rust raw strings (r#\" \"#), though Rust's ability to add more # symbols for nesting is clever.
