      "summary": "Ruby and TypeScript represent backend versus frontend in the web development world, though both prioritize developer experience. Ruby (1995) achieved web dominance through Ruby on Rails (2004), which revolutionized backend development with convention over configuration and rapid scaffolding. TypeScript (2012) brought order to frontend chaos by adding types to JavaScript, enabling large-scale browser applications. Interestingly, JavaScript borrowed heavily from Ruby - array methods (map, filter, reduce) mirror Ruby's blocks and enumerable methods. TypeScript's optional types offer flexibility similar to Ruby's dynamic nature, but with compile-time checking. Both value clean, readable code and have excellent tooling. Ruby's metaprogramming creates elegant DSLs; TypeScript's structural typing creates flexible interfaces. Ruby on Rails full-stack apps dominated startups for years; modern stacks increasingly use Rails backends with React/TypeScript frontends. They're complementary technologies - Ruby for the backend API, TypeScript for the frontend consuming it. Both make developers productive, just on different sides of the HTTP request.",
      "whenToUseLeft": "Choose Ruby for backend web application development, building RESTful APIs, e-commerce platforms, content management systems, startup MVPs needing rapid development, monolithic web applications, when convention over configuration speeds development, server-side rendering applications, background job processing, and teams that value developer happiness and code elegance. Ruby on Rails remains unmatched for backend productivity.",
      "whenToUseRight": "Choose TypeScript for frontend web development with React/Angular/Vue, building SPAs and progressive web apps, Node.js backend services, full-stack JavaScript applications, projects requiring browser execution, teams with JavaScript background, real-time client applications with WebSockets, mobile apps with React Native, and when type safety in the UI layer prevents costly runtime errors. TypeScript dominates modern frontend development."
