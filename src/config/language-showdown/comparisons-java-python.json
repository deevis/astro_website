      "description": "Python's minimalist syntax contrasts sharply with Java's class-based boilerplate.",
      "why": "Python eliminates all ceremony - no class, no main method, no semicolons. Just one line. Python emphasizes readability and simplicity. Java's structure is necessary for its compilation model but verbose for simple tasks. Python is interpreted, Java is compiled.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Python requires no boilerplate",
        "Java needs class and main method",

      "description": "Java requires explicit types while Python uses dynamic typing with no declarations needed.",
      "why": "Python is dynamically typed - variables don't need type declarations. Java requires explicit types (or var in Java 10+). Python determines type at runtime, Java at compile time. Both use UPPERCASE for constants by convention. Python's everything-is-an-object is similar to Ruby but different from Java's primitives.",

      "description": "Python's f-strings and rich methods compare to Java's verbose string manipulation.",
      "why": "Python's f-strings (f\"Hello {name}\") are cleaner than Java's concatenation or String.format. Both have immutable strings. Python has many built-in methods on strings. Java requires StringBuilder for efficient concatenation. Python's approach is more intuitive and concise.",

      "why": "Python uses indentation instead of braces - enforces readable code. Both require explicit boolean expressions (no assignment in conditions). Python has elif, Java has else if. Python's ternary is more readable. Python's truthiness rules: False, None, 0, empty containers are falsy.",

      "description": "Python 3.10+ adds pattern matching while Java has traditional switch statements.",
      "why": "Python 3.10 introduced match/case with powerful pattern matching. Before that, Python used if/elif chains. Java has switch (traditional and modern expressions). Python's pattern matching is more powerful - can destructure, use guards. Java's switch is more limited but getting better.",

      "why": "Python dicts are built-in with clean syntax. Java requires HashMap import and type parameters. Python's dictionary comprehensions are powerful. Both support iteration. Python's .get() method is safer than direct access. Java's approach is more verbose but type-safe.",

      "why": "Python's list comprehensions are idiomatic and readable: [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]. Java requires streams with lambdas and collectors. Python also has filter()/map() but comprehensions are preferred. Both support functional programming but Python's syntax is cleaner.",

      "description": "Python classes are simpler with __init__ while Java requires more boilerplate.",
      "why": "Python uses __init__ instead of constructors named like the class. Python's self is explicit. Java's this is implicit. Python doesn't need access modifiers by default. Java requires public/private. Python is less verbose but less strict about encapsulation.",

      "why": "Python's @property decorator makes getters/setters look like attribute access. Java requires getXxx/setXxx methods. Python's approach is cleaner and more Pythonic. Both support validation in setters. Python often just uses public attributes directly.",

      "why": "Python's json module is in standard library and very simple. Java requires external libraries (Jackson, Gson). Python's dynamic typing makes JSON natural - dicts map directly. Java requires type definitions or verbose casting. Python's approach is more convenient.",

      "why": "Python has a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limiting CPU parallelism. Java has true multi-threading. Python's with lock: is clean. Java has synchronized or explicit locks. For CPU-bound tasks in Python, use multiprocessing. Java's threads are more powerful for parallelism.",
