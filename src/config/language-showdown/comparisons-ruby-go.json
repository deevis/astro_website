    "overview": {
      "summary": "Ruby and Go represent fundamentally different philosophies that happened to emerge from similar frustrations. Ruby (1995) was born from Matz's desire to create a language that made programmers happy, prioritizing elegant syntax, powerful metaprogramming, and flexibility. Go (2009) was born from Google's frustration with C++ and Java complexity, prioritizing simplicity, fast compilation, and straightforward concurrency. Ruby chose expressiveness with multiple ways to accomplish tasks; Go chose minimalism with one obvious way. Ruby's dynamic typing enables rapid iteration; Go's static typing prevents classes of bugs. Ruby on Rails revolutionized web development for startups; Go powers cloud infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes). Ruby emphasizes developer joy through flexibility; Go emphasizes team productivity through constraints. Ruby has the GIL limiting threading; Go has goroutines making concurrency trivial. They rarely compete directly - Ruby for web applications, Go for infrastructure - but both succeeded by making developers' lives better in opposite ways.",
      "whenToUseLeft": "Choose Ruby for rapid web application development with Ruby on Rails, startups needing MVP speed, e-commerce platforms (Shopify's tech stack), projects valuing expressive, readable code, teams prioritizing developer happiness, applications with complex business logic benefiting from metaprogramming, when DSL creation matters, and projects where changing requirements demand flexibility. Ruby excels when developer productivity and code elegance trump raw performance.",
      "whenToUseRight": "Choose Go for cloud-native microservices, DevOps tooling and CLI applications, containerized environments, network services requiring high concurrency, projects needing single binary deployment, teams wanting simple, consistent code, API gateways and proxies, infrastructure as code tools, and when compilation speed and runtime performance matter. Go's simplicity scales to large teams and its goroutines make concurrent programming accessible to all developers."

      "description": "Ruby minimizes ceremony while Go emphasizes simplicity and compilation speed.",
      "why": "Ruby is the simplest - just one line. Go requires package and import declarations. Ruby is interpreted, Go is compiled. Go's compilation is very fast though. Ruby emphasizes developer happiness, Go emphasizes simplicity and performance.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Ruby has minimal boilerplate",
        "Go requires package declaration",

    "variables": {
      "description": "Ruby offers dynamic flexibility while Go provides static type safety with inference.",
      "why": "Ruby is dynamically typed, Go is statically typed. Ruby variables can change types, Go variables cannot. Go's := is like Ruby's = but with type inference. Ruby uses UPPERCASE for constants, Go uses capitalization for visibility. Go catches type errors at compile time.",

    "strings": {
      "description": "Ruby's rich built-in methods contrast with Go's explicit package-based approach.",
      "why": "Ruby has rich built-in string methods. Go requires the strings package. Ruby's #{} interpolation is cleaner than Go's fmt.Sprintf. Both have immutable strings. Ruby's approach is more convenient. Go's is more explicit and performant.",

      "description": "Both offer powerful switch/case without breaks, but with different matching capabilities.",
      "why": "Ruby's case/when can match ranges, regex, classes. Go's switch is also powerful but different. Neither needs break by default. Ruby uses === for matching. Go can switch on types and conditions. Both are more powerful than traditional switches.",
