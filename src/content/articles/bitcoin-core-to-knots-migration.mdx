# Bitcoin Core to Knots Migration: Preserving Bitcoin's Monetary Protocol Focus

<div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row md:gap-6 items-start">
  <div class="flex-1">
    The Bitcoin ecosystem is experiencing a significant shift as node operators increasingly migrate from Bitcoin Core to the Bitcoin Knots implementation. This transition reflects the community's determination to cement Bitcoin as a focused financial monetary protocol and protect it from feature creep that could lead to the same complexity issues faced by other blockchain platforms like Ethereum.

## The Current Situation: Why the Migration Matters

Bitcoin was created with a singular purpose: to serve as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system with a fixed monetary policy. As the ecosystem has grown, there have been increasing pressures to expand Bitcoin's capabilities beyond this core mission. The Bitcoin Knots implementation has emerged as a conservative alternative that prioritizes Bitcoin's fundamental value proposition while resisting unnecessary feature expansion.

<Alert type="info">
  Bitcoin Knots is a full Bitcoin node implementation that provides a more conservative approach to protocol development compared to Bitcoin Core, with a focus on security, privacy, and maintaining Bitcoin's core monetary properties.

## Actors Undermining Bitcoin's Monetary Purpose

The migration to Knots has been accelerated by concerns over specific individuals and organizations whose actions threaten to transform Bitcoin from a monetary protocol into a general-purpose blockchain:

| Actor | Action Taken | Purpose / Effect | Controversy |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Casey Rodarmor | Created the Ordinals protocol | Enabled NFTs and arbitrary data inscriptions on individual sats using Taproot | Triggered explosive growth in block usage for non-financial purposes |
| "Domo" (BRC-20 Creator) | Introduced BRC-20 token standard via Ordinals | Used JSON inscriptions to mint meme tokens on Bitcoin | Sparked congestion, drove fees sky-high, and crowded out regular payments |
| Peter Todd | Authored PR #32359 to remove the 80-byte OP_RETURN limit | Claims it will reduce harmful practices by allowing "cleaner" data storage | Accused of being paid by Chaincode Labs, undermining protocol neutrality |
| Chaincode Labs | Allegedly commissioned the PR to relax OP_RETURN limits | Corporate influence on Bitcoin Core's policy direction | Raised concerns about centralized funding and capture of protocol dev |
| GitHub Moderators | Muted/banned dissenting contributors opposing OP_RETURN changes | Claimed to be moderating toxic behavior | Accused of censorship and silencing pro-monetary voices |
| Taproot Wizards | Promoted re-enabling disabled opcodes like OP_CAT | Claims to expand Bitcoin scripting capabilities | Feared as a backdoor to more bloat, complex smart contracts, and altcoin behavior |

<Alert type="warning">
  These developments have concerned Bitcoin purists who believe that Bitcoin's primary value lies in being a secure, censorship-resistant monetary system rather than a platform for tokens, NFTs, or complex smart contracts.
</Alert>

## Pro-Bitcoin-as-Money (Good) Actors

In contrast to those undermining Bitcoin's monetary focus, several key individuals and organizations are working to preserve Bitcoin's core purpose as sound money:

| Actor / Entity | Role / Contribution | Notable Actions | Philosophy / Stance |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Luke Dashjr | Bitcoin Core dev; maintainer of Bitcoin Knots | Developed Ordisrespector patch; hardened Knots settings; co-founded Ocean mining pool | Hardline anti-spam; monetary-only Bitcoin |
| Bitcoin Mechanic | Educator and content creator | Vocal critic of Ordinals, PR #32359; popularized pro-monetary messaging | Publicly defends Bitcoin's role as sound money |
| Ocean Mining Pool | Mining pool launched by Dashjr with backing from Jack Dorsey | Only mines "clean" blocks (excludes Ordinals/BRC-20s); runs Bitcoin Knots by default | Miner enforcement of monetary purity |
| Jack Dorsey | Supporter of Ocean; founder of Block, Inc. | Funded Ocean pool; outspoken proponent of Bitcoin as apolitical global currency | Supports minimalism and long-term stability |
| Ali Sherief | Developer and contributor | Initiated Bitcoin-dev mailing list thread calling to classify BRC-20s and inscriptions as spam | Advocated for relay/mempool filtering |
| Samson Mow | Bitcoin advocate; CEO of JAN3 | Publicly denounced protocol bloat and PR #32359; warned about loss of monetary identity | Focus on Bitcoin nation-state adoption |
| Matthew Kratter | Educator and YouTuber (Bitcoin University channel) | Produces educational content promoting the switch to Knots from Bitcoin Core; raises awareness about Bitcoin's monetary purpose | Advocates for preserving Bitcoin as digital sound money |
| Bitcoin Knots | Alternative node implementation (maintained by Dashjr) | Enforces strict standardness rules; prevents relay of spam-like Taproot and OP_RETURN transactions | Customizable, hardened Bitcoin for principled use |
| Whirlpool / CoinJoin Devs | Privacy-preserving wallet developers | Some aligned with monetary-only stance; noted that inscription spam can hurt privacy use cases | Critical of bloat harming fungibility |

<Alert type="info">
  These advocates represent the growing movement to preserve Bitcoin's original purpose as sound money and prevent its transformation into a general-purpose blockchain platform with the associated trade-offs and risks.

      B --> E[Long-term Store of Value]
      C --> E
      D --> E
  `}
/>

### 2. Avoiding the "Swiss Army Knife" Problem

Ethereum's versatility as a general-purpose blockchain has created significant complexity, leading to challenges in scaling, security vulnerabilities, and governance issues. Bitcoin advocates are determined to avoid this path.

<Alert type="warning">
  Feature bloat increases attack surface, complicates security audits, and can lead to unexpected interactions between features that create vulnerabilities.
</Alert>

### 3. Focusing on Financial Use Cases

Bitcoin Knots prioritizes improvements that enhance Bitcoin's role as a monetary network while being more conservative about adding features that serve other use cases.
