        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Money is one of humanity's most important inventions, evolving over thousands of years to solve specific problems in trade and value storage.
          In this module, we'll explore the history and evolution of money from primitive barter systems to modern digital currencies.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">The Problem with Barter</h2>
        
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Before money, people traded goods and services directly through barter. While simple in concept, barter has a fundamental flaw:
          it requires a "double coincidence of wants." This means both parties must want exactly what the other has to offer, at the exact
          same time and place.
        </p>
        
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Imagine you're a fisherman wanting to trade fish for pottery. You must find not just any potter, but one who:
        </p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          <li class="mb-2">Wants fish at that moment</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Has pottery to trade</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Values your fish at a rate you find acceptable</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          This inefficiency led to the development of commodity money - items with intrinsic value that were widely accepted for trade.

          <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            The first major transition was from direct barter to using commodities like shells, beads, and cattle as intermediary goods.
            These items had intrinsic value and were generally accepted, solving the double coincidence of wants problem.

          <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            Precious metals, particularly gold and silver, emerged as superior forms of money due to their durability, portability,
            divisibility, and relative scarcity. They maintained value across cultures and time periods.

          <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            As trade expanded, carrying large amounts of gold became impractical. Paper money emerged as receipts for gold stored
            with goldsmiths, introducing the concept of representative money backed by physical reserves.

          <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            The final major transition occurred when governments removed the backing of paper money by gold or silver,
            creating fiat currencies that derive value solely from government decree and public trust.

            Today, we're witnessing another transition as digital currencies emerge. Bitcoin represents the first
            successful attempt to create digital scarcity without requiring trust in a central authority.

        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Money serves three primary functions: as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account. 
          To fulfill these functions effectively, money should possess several important properties:

            <strong class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Portability:</strong> Money should be easy to transport and transfer between parties.

          <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            Throughout history, gold emerged as the dominant form of money because it scored highly on most of these properties. 
            It's extremely durable, universally recognizable, naturally scarce, and perfectly fungible. Its main weaknesses were 
            in portability (it's heavy) and divisibility (difficult to make small payments).

          <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            Paper money was introduced as a solution to gold's portability and divisibility problems. Initially, paper money 
            was backed by gold reserves, maintaining its value through convertibility. However, when this backing was removed, 
            paper money's scarcity property was compromised, leading to inflation and loss of purchasing power over time.

            Bitcoin was designed to combine the best properties of both gold and digital money. It's perfectly durable (digital), 
            highly portable (can be sent anywhere instantly), infinitely divisible (down to 8 decimal places), increasingly 
            recognizable, absolutely scarce (21 million cap), and fungible (each bitcoin is identical).

          <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            The Roman Empire provides one of the most famous examples. Roman rulers gradually reduced the silver
            content in their coins, allowing them to mint more coins from the same amount of silver. This enabled
            them to pay for wars and public works in the short term, but led to inflation and economic instability

          In modern times, the abandonment of the gold standard represents perhaps the most significant debasement
          of money. Until 1971, major currencies were backed by gold, limiting how much money could be created.
          When this constraint was removed, it became possible to create unlimited amounts of currency.

            can spend it before prices rise, while those who receive it last (typically wage earners) find that prices have already

          One of the most fundamental challenges in monetary systems is verifying that the money supply is what it

        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Throughout history, gold has been valued partly because it's difficult to counterfeit. However, when gold

            The expansion and contraction of credit leads to boom and bust cycles. When central banks lower interest rates,
            they encourage borrowing and investment, creating a boom. However, this often leads to malinvestment and eventually

            New money often flows into assets like stocks and real estate before affecting consumer prices.
            This creates asset bubbles and increases wealth inequality, as those who own assets see their wealth increase

            Inflation encourages consumption over saving, leading to lower investment and capital formation.

            The system incentivizes taking on debt, leading to ever-increasing leverage throughout the economy.
            With inflation eroding the value of money, borrowing becomes attractive as debts can be repaid with

            As economic output grows while the money supply remains fixed,

            When money appreciates over time, it encourages saving and

        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Several misconceptions about fixed-supply money systems are worth addressing:

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">The Deflationary Spiral Myth</h3>
          <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            Critics argue that a deflationary currency would cause people to hoard money indefinitely, leading to economic collapse.
            However, historical evidence doesn't support this. People always have time preferences and needs that require spending.
            Even during periods of deflation, people continue to buy what they need and invest in productive assets.

          <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            Another common claim is that the money supply must grow with the economy. However, this confuses price with value.
            In a fixed-supply system, economic growth is reflected in falling prices rather than an expanding money supply.
            This is actually more efficient as it doesn't require constant recalibration of the monetary unit.

          <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            Some argue that modern economies require debt-based money to function. While debt would still exist in a Bitcoin economy,
            it would likely be more conservative and based on genuine savings rather than money created out of thin air.
            This would lead to more sustainable growth patterns.

            It's worth noting that for most of human history, money had a relatively fixed supply (gold, silver).
            Many periods of significant economic growth and innovation occurred under these monetary systems.
            The modern fiat experiment is actually the historical anomaly, not the fixed-supply approach.

            While a Bitcoin-based economy offers many theoretical advantages, the transition from our current system
            would involve significant challenges and adjustments. Debt denominated in fiat currencies would need to be
            addressed, and new financial instruments would need to develop.

          Moving from theory to practice, this module examines the actual performance of Bitcoin compared to the

            The US Dollar has experienced consistent inflation, losing purchasing power every year.
            According to official CPI data, the dollar has lost approximately 30-40% of its purchasing
            power over the past decade, though many argue that real-world inflation has been higher.

            Despite significant volatility, Bitcoin has appreciated dramatically against the US Dollar

            Many Bitcoin investors use a strategy called dollar-cost averaging (DCA), where they invest a fixed amount

            What's clear is that Bitcoin represents a fundamental innovation in money - one that combines the best
